# Refactoring-Code

A marketing agency wanted a code base that follows the accessibility standards and is optismised for search engines.

In summary a refactoring of code is necessary.
I have consolidated and organized the CSS selectors and properties to follow semantic structure and ensured the application's CSS file is properly commented to assist with future development if needed.

As well as fixing the few bugs within the code I have refactored to ensure it is now optimised for use and organised in a way that allows for easier accessibility if needed by myself or others.
